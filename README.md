# APLN552---Final

This code is a replication of the main code in https://github.com/aidanematzadeh/word_learning.git - All code, support documents, and data were taken from this source. The goal of this was to run new data on this code to make comparisons between the original and AI generated Child Directed Speech Data

There are two main files here - Replication and CDS Expansion. Both use the original author's main() script, data, and supporting documents almost identically, with a few tweaks for compaitbility. They should all be able to be run as is, as long as the support documents and data are downloaded.
